\subsection{DC-DC converter}
The presence of a DC-DC converter leads in control and adjustment of the unregulated DC voltage of output voltage to optimal voltage. The advantages of presence of a DC-DC converter include increase or decrease the dc voltage and adjusting the output voltage according to load changes. These benefits are possible with change of the duty cycle (D). Depending on their output voltage value, different DC-DC converter configurations exist in literature boost, buck, buck-boost, flyback, forward, half and full bridge and etc.
